# Welcome
This is an onboarding guide for new backend developers at Virtual Identity.

We as a backend community want to be on a bleeding age of techs. How? Just look at our <a href="http://manifest-dev.virtual-identity.com/">Development manifesto</a>

In case of having questions in any steps please do not hesitate to ask from your buddy.

For backend development at VI, we basically have 2 supported technology stacks:
- Java Microservices (built with Spring Boot)
- Serverless functions (built with AWS services, especially  Lambda functions)

To start your onboarding on the Java Microservices stack, go on [here](java_microservice.md)
