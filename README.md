# Welcome
This is an onboarding guide for new backend developers at Virtual Identity.
In case of having questions in any steps please do not hesitate to ask from your buddy.

For backend development at VI, we basically have 2 supported technology stacks:
- Java Microservices (build with Spring Boot)
- Serverless functions (build with AWS services, especially  Lamda functions)

To start your onboarding on the Java Microservices stack, go on [here](java_microservice.md)
